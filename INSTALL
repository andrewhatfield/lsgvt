Installation instructions:

It's a python file. Place it somewhere in your $PATH. Suggestions are:

/usr/local/bin
~/bin
~/.local/bin

Make it executable and you're done

If, on your distro, the path /var/lib/glusterd/vols does not exist,
you should point the variable volpath in the script to the correct location

Have fun!
